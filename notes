Page for note taking manages by AlexPH for the team work path on the marking scheme and to help the team out to know
what everyone has done and is working on to help stop confusion.

Due to our team members changing due to some absent individuals and the closure of some other teams our start
allot later than many of the other teams which means we need to work more as a team and harder to reach the deadline.

22/3 lesson time
